## Editing in Linux:

There are several editors available to you in Linux, this might change in a different operating system. Here are some of the most common ones:

* `nano`
* `vim`
* `emacs`

### Nano

Nano is a simple text editor that is easy to use. To open a file with nano, type `nano [filename]`. To save and exit, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and finally `Enter` to save. 

### Vim

Vim is a more complex text editor that is very powerful. To open a file with vim, type `vim [filename]`. To edit, press `i` to enter insert mode (you should see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the terminal). To exit insert mode, press `Esc`. To save and exit, press `Esc` to enter command mode, then type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit. To exit without saving, press `Esc` to enter command mode, then type `:q!` and press `Enter`. If you have done no changes, you can also press `:q` and `Enter` to exit.

### Emacs

Emacs is another powerful text editor. To open a file with emacs, type `emacs [filename]`. To save and exit, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Ctrl + S` to save, and finally `Ctrl + X` and `Ctrl + C` to exit. The advantage of emacs is that it opens in a graphical interface, which can be easier to use.
