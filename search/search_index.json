In the latest versions of ROOT, specially if you install it on your own machine, there is an annoying new feature were it will always try to open a browser window whenever you draw stuff. You can disable this by opening root like <code>root -l --web=off [more options] [file]</code>.</p> <p>CHECK 3</p>"},{"location":"lecture2/","title":"Lecture2","text":"<p>to fill</p>"},{"location":"lecture3/","title":"Lecture3","text":"<p>to fill</p>"}]}
